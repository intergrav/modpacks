This is a monorepo for my Minecraft modpacks. I'm unsure if I'll actually use this - we're just messing around with it and I'm learning how to use one.

The main limitations so far:
- Old auto updating instances may break
- Wiki may be confusing to use since it'll have all my packs
- Forks may be confusing and not ideal, though Merith is currently working on a tool to solve that
